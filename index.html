                • Systems design serves as a blueprint for how different elements of a digital environment should cooperate to provide smooth functionality and integration. It places a strong emphasis on flexibility, adaptability, and the system's ability to change and grow with time in order to satisfy users' increasing needs and technology breakthroughs (<i>Interaction Design Foundation, 2019</i>).

                • The technical procedures and approaches that promote the development of reliable systems are the main emphasis of engineering. This entails using dependable frameworks, tools, and procedures to complete projects quickly while maintaining stability and reducing errors all the way through the development lifecycle (<i>Nielsen, 2012</i>).

                • Development operations are structured by organization, which includes team dynamics, collaboration tools, and workflows. Effective communication, streamlined processes, and increased productivity are all facilitated by proper organization, and these factors eventually contribute to the success of the project (<i>Moran, 2018</i>).
