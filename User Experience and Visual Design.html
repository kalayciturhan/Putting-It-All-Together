                <h2>User Experience (UX)</h2>
                <p>The total experience a user has while utilizing a system, product, or service is known as the user experience (UX). The goal of UX design is to give people smooth, simple, and pleasurable experiences. It covers all aspects of the interaction, such as performance, usability, accessibility, and general satisfaction. A well-designed user experience (UX) guarantees that users can efficiently accomplish their goals by navigating digital platforms with little annoyance. UX is primarily concerned with how a system or product makes consumers feel, not merely with functionality. User loyalty, engagement, and retention are all directly impacted by positive UX. Understanding user wants, preferences, and behaviors is a crucial component of user experience (UX). This understanding informs the development of user-friendly interfaces that satisfy users' expectations. To guarantee that users find the system not only helpful but also pleasurable to use, UX designers must include both functional and emotional components in their designs (Nielsen, 2022).</p>

                <h2>Visual Design</h2>
                <p>Users' initial perceptions and feelings with a product are greatly influenced by visual design. By promoting utility and improving the user experience, it transcends aesthetics. Good visual design gives people a feeling of organization, facilitates comprehension of information, and visually directs them around a digital environment. To create interactions that feel organic and interesting, it involves the thoughtful application of components such as layout, colors, images, and typography. By producing a user-friendly and visually appealing experience, good visual design not only draws in users but also keeps them around. Because it creates the initial visual effect that can either promote or discourage further involvement, visual design is one of the seven crucial variables that influence total user experience (UX). A consistent and carefully considered color scheme is one example of a visual element that can elicit feelings, convey brand identification, and strengthen functioning. Additionally, the way these design components are integrated should be consistent and in line with the platform's goals to make sure that the aesthetic appeal complements the functionality rather than takes away from it (Interaction Design Foundation, 2019).</p>

                <h2>Priority Justification</h2>
                <p>It is crucial to stress the close connection between visual design and user experience while arguing for their significance. Making digital platforms useful is only one aspect of user experience (UX); another is using careful visual design to build strong relationships with users. Both components are essential to guaranteeing consumer loyalty and happiness. While a visually beautiful platform without good UX design can irritate customers and discourage participation, a product with excellent functionality but poor visual design can feel alienated. UX and visual design work together to enhance a platform's usability, emotional appeal, and consumer appeal. As a result, it is crucial to give top priority to developing designs that are not only intuitive and user-centered but also aesthetically pleasing and consistent.</p>
