                A key idea in web design, information architecture (IA) forms the basis of a website's usability. It includes organizing and structuring information so that people can easily browse and locate what they're looking for. By giving content logical structures, a well-designed IA guarantees that a digital environment is simple and user-friendly. In addition to making it easier for users to locate information fast, this structure also makes it easier for them to comprehend how various pieces of information relate to one another inside the system. By simplifying navigation, effective IA reduces user annoyance by enabling users to navigate between parts with ease and find what they need fast. It is impossible to overestimate the significance of information architecture (IA) since poorly designed websites might have high bounce rates and low user engagement due to its disorganization and inefficiency. Designers can produce more accessible, effective, and pleasurable digital experiences for users by putting into practice an IA that takes user needs, behavior, and expectations into account (Rohrer, 2022).

                Improving the usability and accessibility of material requires proper taxonomy design and metadata. The information that characterizes other information and facilitates content retrieval, search, and classification is known as metadata. Finding the most pertinent content is made easier by more effective information filtering and sorting made possible by correctly specified and implemented metadata. The classification technique used to arrange or categorize content, however, is called taxonomy. A well-thought-out taxonomy structure guarantees that information is arranged logically and is simple for users to find. By promoting a smooth user experience, these two components are essential to enhancing a digital platform's overall content strategy. Users can anticipate where to locate specific sorts of information, such as articles, blog posts, products, or services, when a taxonomy system is clear and consistent. Optimizing the design of taxonomies and metadata speeds up users' access to relevant data, which enhances usability, engagement, and user happiness. Additionally, because appropriate metadata and taxonomy can enhance search engine visibility and ranking, which increases website traffic and reach, these systems also have a big impact on search engine optimization (SEO) (Farrell, 2017).
